# College Course Planner

Check this website for the deployment https://courseplanner-1.vercel.app/
Attempting to schedule my classes for upcoming semesters while ensuring I met all my degree requirements was quite challenging and exhausting. 


To address this challenge, I developed the College Course Planner, enabling users to easily schedule classes by semester, tally up total credits, and verify degree requirements.

## Features

- Add and delete classes with ease.  
- Create and add classes currently not in the database.  
- Integrate spring semesters and courses taken prior to college enrollment.  
- Comprehensively map out degree requirements.  
- Store and retrieve your schedules securely by signing in.  
- Instantly calculate the total credits accumulated.  


Built on a robust foundation of React, this project employs Bootstrap CSS for a seamless user interface and Firebase as its backend database.

As of now, the planner is tailor-made for Computer Science majors at the University of Michigan. However, there's a vision to expand its horizons and encompass various other majors in the near future.
